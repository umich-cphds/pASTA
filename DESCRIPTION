Description: Classical methods for combining summary data from genome-wide
    association studies (GWAS) only use marginal genetic effects and power can
    be compromised in the presence of heterogeneity. pASTA is an R package that
    implements p-value Assisted Subset Testing for Association, a method that
    generalizes the previously proposed association analysis based on subsets
    (ASSET) method by incorporating gene-environment (G-E) interactions
    into the testing procedure.
