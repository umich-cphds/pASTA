Description: Classical methods for combining summary data from genome-wide
    association studies (GWAS) only use marginal genetic effects and power can
    be compromised in the presence of heterogeneity. 'subgxe' is a R package
    that implements p-value assisted subset testing for association (pASTA),
    a method developed by Yu et al. (2019) \doi{10.1159/000496867}. pASTA
    generalizes association analysis based on subsets by incorporating
    gene-environment interactions into the testing procedure.
